# Implementation Planning Process

This document outlines the standard process for planning feature implementations in this project.

## Planning Process Steps

### 1. Understand the Requirements
- **For GitHub tickets**: Use `gh issue view [number]` to fetch ticket details
- **For ad-hoc requests**: Clarify requirements through discussion
- Read/identify requirements, features, benefits, and technical approach
- Identify any constraints or considerations

### 2. Research the Codebase
- Use TodoWrite tool to track planning progress
- Mark research as "in_progress"
- Examine existing file structure and architecture
- Understand how new features will integrate with current patterns
- Follow existing patterns and testing constraints
- Mark research as "completed" when done

### 3. Create Comprehensive Plan Document
Create `plan.md` with the following sections (If one already exists, stop and ask what to do):

#### Required Sections:
- **Overview** - Brief description of what we're implementing
- **File Structure Changes** - New files and modified files
- **New Classes/Functions** - List classes and functions with proper structure
- **Implementation Strategy** - Technical approach details
- **Code Modifications** - What changes to existing files
- **Testing Strategy** - How new code will be tested
- **Implementation Checklist** - Step-by-step tasks with checkboxes

#### Key Considerations:
- **Follow existing patterns** - Maintain consistency with current architecture
- **Maintain testability** - All new code must be testable with proper mocks
- **Code quality** - Must pass make lint (ruff, pyright, pylint)
- **Type safety** - Use proper type hints throughout
- **Error handling** - Include proper exception handling and logging

### 4. Address Specific Questions
During planning, explicitly address:
- **File locations** - Where new files will live
- **Class/function signatures** - How they will follow existing patterns
- **Testing approach** - How new code will be tested
- **Integration points** - How new code connects to existing code
- **Manual testing** - How to verify the feature works
- **Database considerations** - Any schema changes or data migrations
- **Configuration** - Any new settings or environment variables
- **Documentation updates** - Changes needed to README.md, usage instructions, new commands

### 5. Create Step-by-Step Checklist
Break implementation into phases with specific checkboxes:
- **Phase 1** - Core files/infrastructure
- **Phase 2** - Implementation following existing patterns
- **Phase 3** - Testing and documentation
- **Phase 4** - Manual verification steps
- **Phase 5** - Quality assurance (make lint, make generate, regression testing)

### 6. Document Future Maintenance
- Note any ongoing maintenance requirements
- Explain any new concepts that future developers need to understand
